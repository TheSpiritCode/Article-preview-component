## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

First time making tooltip out of div. Not so easy at first glance. Also first time making icons as a span with background - useful when creating icons with changeable colors.
